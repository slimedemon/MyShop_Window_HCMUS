# MyShop Project Source Code Guide

This is the source code folder of the MyShop solution/project.

## Step 1: Initialize Database and Testing Data
Before running the MyShop project, if you haven't, you need to initialize the database and testing data. Follow these steps:
1. **Install MS SQL Server:**
   - If you don't have MS SQL Server installed, download and install it from the official Microsoft website.
2. **Use MS SQL Management Studio:**
   - Open MS SQL Management Studio and connect to your SQL Server instance.
3. **Run MyShopDB.sql Script:**
   - Locate the `MyShopDB.sql` script in the project files.
   - Execute the script to create the MyShop database schema and populate it with testing data.
The database is now set up for the MyShop project.

## Step 2: Open the Solution and Run the Project
Now that the database is initialized, follow these steps to open and run the MyShop project in Visual Studio:
1. **Open the Solution:**
   - Launch Visual Studio and open the MyShop solution file (`MyShop.sln`).
3. **Run the Project in Debug Mode:**
   - Set the solution configuration to "Debug."
   - Press F5 or click on the "Start Debugging" button to build and run the MyShop project.

   Note: Running in Debug mode is recommended, as Release mode may have additional configurations for publishing, and running in Visual Studio can simplify the process.
